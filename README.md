# emacs-pure
emacs with native + libjson what I used to use nowadays ...   
I can start emacs with this setup ~ 1sec in win10 and linux as well.   

## Install   
all-the-icons-install-fonts   
win: msys2 (install: git, diffutils), ($PATH + c:/msys2/usr/bin)   
win maybe: ~/.gitconfig (sslVerify = false)   
ripgrep   

## progs
lsp installed   
haskell (haskell-ide-engine)   
...

## tools
restclient   
ripgrep   
magit as git client   
notes in the menu can list a folder to reach the org files easily   

## keys
C-j a new key-prefix   
C-l the short menu (good point to start restclient, gitclient, notes)   
f2 file-explorer (treemacs)   
f1 toggle bigger bottom panel   
shift+f1 toggle hide side windows   
Ctrl-Tab next window   

## Mouse
Right click => menu   
Modeline+right click => close the window   

## Layout
A main window   
bottom panel   
left panel   

You can split the main window (C-x 2, C-x 3) but it won't do it manually.
